2. Aims of workshop
===================

1. Get hands-on experience with the basic elements of data analysis
   in R.

2. Understand how to import data from a CSV file into an R data frame.

3. Use standard tools to summarize & manipulate data frames.

4. Learn how to install & use R packages.

5. Use ggplot2 to plot data.

6. Learn through "live coding".

# 3. Our goal: Analyze Divvy data from 2016 & 2017

+ Investigate bike sharing trends in Chicago.

+ We will use data made available by Divvy:

    - www.divvybikes.com/system-data

+ Much of the effort will be spent importing the data, inspecting the
  data, and preparing the data for analysis.

+ Once we have carefully prepared the data, creating visualizations is
  (relatively) little effort.

4. The programmatic approach
============================

+ Data analysis usually involves *iterative refinement* and *repetition*.

+ The *programmatic approach* to data analysis will allow you to...

    - Quickly reproduce existing analyses.

    - Quickly create new analyses by building on existing code.

    - Expand capabilities with R packages.

5. It's your choice
===================

Your may choose to...

+ Use R on your laptop.

+ Use RStudio on your laptop.

+ Use R or RStudio on the RCC cluster.

+ Pair up with your neighbour.

+ Follow what I do on the projector.


6. Software we will use today
=============================

1. **R** and/or **RStudio**.

2. R packages **readr**, **ggplot2** & **cowplot**.


# 7. Outline of workshop

1. Initial setup.

2. Load & prepare the Divvy station data.

3. Load & prepare the Divvy trip data.

4. Create a map of the Divvy stations.

5. Create plots comparing bike sharing in 2016 & 2017.

# 8. Initial setup

+ WiFi.

+ Power outlets.

+ Computer clutter.

+ Workshop packet.

+ Reading what I type.

+ Pace, questions (e.g., keyboard shortcuts).

+ Help.

9. Download or "clone" git repository
=====================================

Download the workshop packet to your computer.

+ Go to: [**http://github.com/rcc-uchicago/R-intro-divvy**][github-repo]

+ To download, click the green **"Clone or download"** button.

Or, if you have **git**, run this command:

```{bash download-repo, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/
  R-intro-divvy.git
```

(Note the URL in the git command should not contain any spaces.)

+ If necessary, uncompress the ZIP file.

+ If necessary, rename folder to **R-intro-divvy**.


10. What's included in the workshop packet
==========================================

+ **slides.pdf**: These slides.

+ **slides.Rmd**: R Markdown source used to generate these
  slides. *Open this file in RStudio or your favourite editor.*

+ **readdivvydata.R**: Some R code used in the hands-on examples.

11. Set up your R environment
=============================

+ Launch R or RStudio.

12. Run `sessionInfo()`
=======================

Check the version of R that you are using:

```{r check-version}
sessionInfo()
```


13. Clear your R environment
============================

The R environment is where all variables (and functions) are stored and
accessed. You should start with an empty environment. Run this:

```{r check-env}
ls()
```

If this outputs names of objects, it means your environment is not
empty and you should restart R with a clean environment. Do either:

+ `rm(list = ls())`.

+ Or, in RStudio, **Session > Clear Workspace**.


14. Load code for the hands-on exercises
========================================

Open R Markdown source file, **slides.Rmd**.

  + In RStudio, select **File > Open File**.

  + Alternatively, use your favourite text editor.

15. The Console is the "brains" of RStudio
==========================================

![](docs/images/rstudio.jpg)

16. Download the Divvy data
===========================

+ Disk space required: about **2 GB**.

+ Download the 2016 & 2017 data files from here:

    + [**www.divvybikes.com/system-data**][divvy-data]

+ Download them to the **R-intro-divvy** folder.

+ You should have 4 ZIP files:

    ```
    Divvy_Trips_2016_Q1Q2.zip
    Divvy_Trips_2016_Q3Q4.zip
    Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1Q2.zip
    Divvy_Trips_2017_Q3Q4.zip
    ```

+ Decompress ("unzip") all of these files.

17. Check that you have all the files 
=====================================

After unzipping, you should have **15** CSV files. Verify this:

```{r list-files}
list.files(pattern = "*.csv")
```


18. Set your working directory to "R-intro-divvy"
=================================================

Check that you have the right working directory:

```{r check-wd}
getwd() # Should end with "R-intro-divvy".
```

If you don't, change your working directory:

  + In R, use `setwd()` function.

  + In RStudio, select **Session > Set Working Directory > Choose
    Directory...`**

Before continuing, double-check that you have the right working directory.

19. Outline of workshop
=======================

1. Initial setup.

2. **Load & prepare the Divvy station data.**

3. Load & prepare the Divvy trip data.

4. Create a map of the Divvy stations.

5. Create plots comparing bike sharing in 2016 & 2017.

# 20. Take a quick look at CSV file

Open the CSV file **Divvy_Stations_2017_Q1Q2.csv** in RStudio, or in
your favourite text editor (e.g., Notepad in Windows, TextEdit on
Mac).


21. Import the station data into R
==================================

Load 2017 third & fourth quarter station data into an R "data frame":

```{r read-station-data}
stations<-read.csv("Divvy_Stations_2017_Q3Q4.csv",
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

This will define a new object, "stations", in your environment:

```{r inspect-station-data-1}
ls()
```

It is a "data frame" object:

```{r inspect-station-data-2}
class(stations)
```


22. Inspect the station data
============================

Check that the data were read correctly, and inspect the table:

```{r inspect-station-data-3}
nrow(stations)
ncol(stations)
head(stations)
tail(stations)
summary(stations)
```

Inspect the data in more detail:

```{r inspect-station-data-4}
sapply(stations,class)
object.size(stations)
```


23. Take a closer look at the "dpcapacity" column
=================================================

Select only the "dpcapacity" column, and assign it to a new variable:

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-1}
x <- stations$dpcapacity
```

Run these commands to take a closer look at the "dpcapacity" column:

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-2}
class(x)
length(x)
summary(x)
table(x)
```


24. More on selecting rows & columns
====================================

Select first 4 rows of "name" column:

```{r select-rows}
stations$name[1:4]
stations[1:4,2]
stations[1:4,"name"]
```

Select first 4 rows of several columns:

```{r select-columns}
stations[1:4,c(2,3,6)]
stations[1:4,c("name","city","dpcapacity")]
```

Getting the row and column names:

```{r station-names}
colnames(stations)
rownames(stations)
```

25. Take an even closer look at "dpcapacity"
============================================

It is interesting that a couple of the Divvy bike stations have no
docks. What are these stations?

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-3}
subset(stations,dpcapacity == 0)
```

How would we view the largest stations?

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-4}
# -------------
# Add code here
# -------------
```


26. Ordering the stations by number of docks
============================================

Here's another look at the smallest and largest stations:

```{r inspect-dpcapcity-data-4}
rows <- order(stations$dpcapacity)
stations2 <- stations[rows,]
head(stations2)
tail(stations2)
```


27. Take a closer look at the "city" column
===========================================

Previously, we inspected *numeric* data. Next's, let's look at an
example of non-numeric data.

```{r inspect-city-data-1}
x <- stations$city
class(x)
summary(x)
```

The summary is not very useful here! The key is to convert to a
"factor" (*i.e.,* categorical variable):

```{r inspect-city-data-2}
x <- factor(stations$city)
class(x)
summary(x)
```


28. Fixing the "city" column
============================

Let's fix the problem of two "Chicago" categories. First, select the
offending rows of the table:

```{r revise-city-data-1}
rows <- which(stations$city == "Chicago ")
```

Fix the "city" column by *overwriting* the "city" entries in the
selected rows:

```{r revise-city-data-2}
stations[rows,"city"] <- "Chicago"
summary(stations$city)
```

The "city" column is more useful if it is a factor. Let's modify
this column *inside* the data frame:

```{r revise-city-data-3}
stations$city <- factor(stations$city)
summary(stations$city)
```


29. What is a factor?
=====================

Factors are often very useful in data analyses. Let's take another
look at what a factor is.

```{r inspect-factor}
x <- stations$city
attributes(x)
unclass(x)
```

From the `unclass(x)` call, we see that a factor under-the-hood is an
integer with values 1, 2, 3, *etc*, with which each integer value is
associated with a *label* ("Chicago", "Evanston", "Oak Park").

30. Save your code & session state
==================================

It is important to periodically save:

1. your code,

2. the state of your R environment.

To save your environment, go to **Session > Save Workspace As...** in
RStudio, or run this code:

```{r save-session-1}
save.image("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

Later, to restore your environment in a new session, select **Session >
Load Workspace...** in RStudio, or run this code:

```{r load-session, eval=FALSE}
load("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

31. Main concepts covered so far
================================

+ The R environment & working directory.

+ Read a data frame from a text (CSV) file.

+ Tools to inspect a data frame.

+ Tools to manipulate a data frame.

+ Selecting rows & columns.

+ Ordering rows of a data frame.

+ Factors = categorical variables.

+ Save state of R environment.

32. Outline of workshop
=======================

1. Initial setup.

2. Load and prepare the Divvy station data.

3. **Load and prepare the Divvy trip data.**

4. Create a map of the Divvy stations.

5. Create a scatterplot comparing bike sharing activity in 2016
   and 2017.

# 33. Import the Divvy trip data into R

Previously, we used `read.csv` to import station data into R. Let's
now use `read.csv` to load the trip data from the 4th quarter of 2017:

```{r read-trip-data}
trips <-
  read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2017_Q4.csv",
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

You may find that this command look longer to run than before. The
trips data frame is much larger:

```{r trip-data-size}
nrow(trips)
ncol(trips)
object.size(trips)
```


34. Import Divvy trip data using `readr`
========================================

Install the **readr** package from CRAN:

```{r install-readr, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
```

Load the package functions into your R environment:

```{r load-readr}
library(readr)
```

Let's use the `read_csv` function from this package:

```{r read-trip-data-readr}
trips <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2017_Q4.csv")
```


35. Import Divvy trip data using `readr`
========================================

The `read_csv` output is *not* a data frame—it is a "tibble".

```{r check-trip-data-class}
class(trips)
```

Usually, I convert it to a data frame:

```{r convert-trip-data}
class(trips) <- "data.frame"
```


36. A first glance at the trips data
====================================

Let's use some of the same commands we used earlier to quickly get an
overview of the trip data:

```{r inspect-trip-data}
nrow(trips)
ncol(trips)
head(trips)
summary(trips)
```


37. Convert "gender" to a factor
================================

Let's begin by converting the "gender" column to a factor:

```{r convert-trip-data-1}
trips$gender <- factor(trips$gender)
summary(trips$gender)
levels(trips$gender)
```


38. Missing data
================

+ In R, "missing data" should be assigned the special value `NA` ("not
  available").

+ Many functions in R will correctly handle missing data as long as
  they are encoded as `NA`.

+ The `read_csv` function from the `readr` package was "smart" enough
  to figure out that blank entries in the CSV file should be converted
  to `NA`.

39. Convert "station" columns to factors
========================================

Likewise, the "from station" column is also more useful as a factor:

```{r summarize-from-station-data}
summary(trips$from_station_name)
trips$from_station_name <-
  factor(trips$from_station_name)
summary(trips$from_station_name)
```


40. A note about dates & times
==============================

+ `summary(trips$start_time)` and `summary(trips$end_time)` are also
  not informative.

+ Processing dates & times is more complicated.

+ See `help(strptime)` and the **lubridate** package.

41 Combining trip data from two quarters
=========================================

Up to this point, we have only examined at the trip data from one
quarter of one year. Suppose we wanted to analyze the trip
data from both the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2017. How would we do that?
First, we have to import both tables.

```{r read-Q3-trip-data-readr}
tripsQ4 <- trips
tripsQ3 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2017_Q3.csv")
class(tripsQ3) <- "data.frame"
```

We can *merge* the two tables *by row*---that is, we put one table on
top of the other. 

```{r merge-trip-data}
trips <- rbind(tripsQ4,tripsQ3)
```


42. Combining trip data from two quarters
=========================================

Let's double-check the result:

```{r check-merge}
dim(tripsQ3)
dim(tripsQ4)
dim(trips)
head(trips)
```


43. Preparing data is tedious
=============================

Data preparation is sometimes >90% of the effort!

+ *Many analysis mistakes are due to poor data preparation.*

Common issues include:

+ Formatting mistakes in CSV file.

+ Converting table columns to the appropriate data type.

+ Inconsistent data entry (e.g., additional spaces).

+ Missing data.

44. Moving beyond data preparation
==================================

+ So far, we have illustrated a few of the challenges of working with
  large tabular data sets ("data frames").

+ In order to proceed to fun stuff, I've automated the data
  preparation steps by writing an R *function* to do this.

45. Outline of workshop
=======================

1. Initial setup.

2. Load & prepare the Divvy station data.

3. Load & prepare the Divvy trip data.

4. **Create a map of the Divvy stations.**

5. Create plots comparing bike sharing in 2016 & 2017.

# 46. Refresh your environment

We will begin a new analysis, so let's refresh our environment:

```{r clean-up-environment}
rm(list = ls())
```

Or, in RStudio, go to **Session > Restart R**.

47. Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=====================================

Load function `read.divvy.data` that automates the reading and
processing of all the downloaded Divvy data:

```{r load-functions}
source("readdivvydata.R")
```

47. Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=====================================

The `read.divvy.data` takes the name of the station file to import,
and the names of trip data files to import & merge.

```{r import-divvy-data-1}
stationfile <- "Divvy_Stations_2017_Q3Q4.csv"
tripfiles <- list.files(pattern="Divvy_Trips_*") 
```


48. Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=====================================

Load and process the station data:

```{r import-divvy-data-2}
stations <- read.station.data(stationfile)
```

Load and process the trip data:

```{r import-divvy-data-3}
trips <- read.trip.data(tripfiles,stations)
```

Loading the trip data may take a minute to run, or longer if you have
not installed the readr package.


49. Inspect the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
======================================

```{r inspect-divvy-data}
head(stations)
summary(stations)
nrow(trips)
head(trips)
summary(trips)
```


50. Our first plot: a map of the Divvy stations
===============================================

We will use the
[**ggplot2** package](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2). It is a
powerful (though not immediately intuitive) set of plotting functions
that extend the base plotting functions in R.

```{r install-ggplot, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

I also recommend the **cowplot** package, an extension to ggplot2
developed by Claus Wilke at UT Austin.

```{r install-cowplot, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cowplot")
```

Load the ggplot2 and cowplot functions:

```{r load-ggplot}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```

51. Plot station longitude vs. latitude
=======================================

The "stations" data frame gives the geographic co-ordinates (latitude
& longitude) for each station. With ggplot, we can create a station
map from the "stations" data frame in only a few lines of code:

```{r plot-station-map-1}
a <- aes(x = longitude,y = latitude)
p <- ggplot(stations,a)
print(p)
g  <- geom_point()
p2 <- ggplot_add(g,p)
print(p2)
```


52. Adjusting the plot
======================

Let's make a few adjustments to the plot:

```{r plot-station-map-2}
g  <- geom_point(shape = 21,fill = "limegreen",
                 color = "white",size = 3)
p3 <- ggplot_add(g,p)
print(p3)
```

53. Use colors to highlight the largest stations
================================================

To do this, map the "dpcapacity" column to colour in the plot:

```{r plot-station-map-4}
a <- aes(x    = longitude,
         y    = latitude,
         fill = dpcapacity)
p <- ggplot(stations,a)
g <- geom_point(shape = 21,color = "white",
                size = 3)
p <- ggplot_add(g,p)
print(p)
```

54. Use colors to highlight the largest stations
================================================

The colour scale is not great, so let's improve it:

```{r plot-station-map-5}
g <- scale_fill_gradient2(low = "dodgerblue",
  mid = "darkblue",high = "red",midpoint = 25)
p <- ggplot_add(g,p)
print(p)
```


55. Scale stations by the number of departures
==============================================

To do this, we need to add a new column to the "stations" data frame
containing the total number departures. It can be calculated from the
"trips" data frame:

```{r count-trips-per-station}
counts <- table(trips$from_station_name)
```

Because we carefully prepared the data frame in `read.divvy.data`,
station counts should be the same order as the stations. We can check
this:

```{r check-station-trip-counts}
all(names(counts) == stations$name)
```


56. Scale stations by the number of departures
==============================================

Add the trip counts to the "stations" data frame:

```{r add-counts-to-stations}
counts <- as.vector(counts)
stations$departures <- counts
head(stations)
```

Let's use this column in our new plot:

```{r plot-station-map-6}
a <- aes(x    = longitude,
         y    = latitude,
 	     size = sqrt(departures))
p <- ggplot(stations,a)
g <- geom_point(shape = 21,fill = "white",
                color = "black")
p <- ggplot_add(g,p)
print(p)
```

57. Save & share your plot
==========================

For exploratory analyses, GIF and PNG are great formats because the
files are easy to attach to emails or webpages:

```{r save-station-map-png}
ggsave("station_map.png",p,dpi = 100)
```

For print or publication, save in a vector graphics format:

```{r save-station-map-pdf}
ggsave("station_map.pdf",p)
```

58. Save your code & session state
==================================

This is a good time to save your session.

```{r save-session-2}
save.image("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

59. Compare 2016 & 2017 biking activity (optional)
==================================================

Earlier, we noticed that that were more trips in 2017 than 2016. Which
stations experienced the largest increase? To examine this question,
we take the following steps:

1. Count trips from each station separately for 2016 and 2017.

2. Add these counts to the "stations" data frame.

# 60. Count trips separately for 2016 & 2017

We will use `subset` followed by `table` to do this:

```{r count-trips-by-year}
d1 <- subset(trips,start.year == 2016)
d2 <- subset(trips,start.year == 2017)
x1 <- table(d1$from_station_name)
x2 <- table(d2$from_station_name)
```

61. Add counts to the stations data frame
=========================================

Remember we need to convert the "table" output to a vector:

```{r add-counts-by-year-to-data-frame}
x1 <- as.vector(x1)
x2 <- as.vector(x2)
stations$dep.2016 <- x1
stations$dep.2017 <- x2
head(stations)
```

62. Scatterplot of trips by station (2016 vs. 2017)
===================================================

As before, now that we have prepared a data frame, plotting with
ggplot is relatively easy:

```{r plot-2016-vs-2017-trips-1}
a <- aes(x = dep.2016,y = dep.2017)
p <- ggplot(stations,a)
g <- geom_point(shape = 1,size = 2,
                color = "darkblue")
p <- ggplot_add(g,p)
print(p)		
```

63. Scatterplot of trips by station
===================================

It is difficult to tell which stations had more trips in 2017---we
need to compare against the x = y line.

```{r plot-2016-vs-2017-trips-2}
g2 <- geom_abline(slope = 1,color = "orange",
                  linetype = "dashed")
p  <- ggplot_add(g2,p)
print(p)
```


64. Save your code & session state
==================================

Save your final results for safekeeping.

```{r save-session-3}
save.image("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

65. ggplot: Take home points
============================

+ Creating sophisticated plots requires relatively little effort
*provided the data are in the right form.*

+ All plots in ggplot2 require these three elements:

    1. A data frame.

    2. An "aesthetic mapping" that declares how columns are mapped to
       plot features (axes, shapes, colors, *etc.*).

    3. A "geom", short for “geometric object,” that specifies the type
        of plot.

+ All plots are created by *adding layers.*

66. Why data analysis in R?
===========================

+ In R, a spreadsheet ("data frame") is an *object* that can be inspected,
  manipulated and summarized with code.

+ Therefore, we can write scripts to *automate* our data analyses.

67. Parting thoughts
====================

1. Always record your analysis steps in a file so you can reproduce
   them later.

2. Keep track of which packages (and the versions) you
   used with `sessionInfo()`.

3. Use "R Markdown" to document your analyses.

4. Use packages---don’t reinvent the wheel.

5. Email help@rcc.uchicago.edu for advice on using R on the RCC
   cluster.

6. See the **workflowr** package for simplifying organizing & sharing
   of data analyses; e.g., **stephenslab.github.io/wflow-divvy**.
